        This process is so much time consuming and does not provide trust on retailers. There is the threat of forgery if you are new to marketing and do not know how to bargain from these streets sellers. There is no proper way of getting to know about the actual price of the books sometime shopkeepers sell it more than the market price by saying that the book is not available in the market. It might be the case that shopkeepers do not refund money if you purchase some wrong books. So, above this is the whole process of bookstore management system but by our system, we can make it little bit more simple and fast process to mechanize it. We can automate this process by creating the application which will allow you to use these things in a fully functional way and the application will include the following entities (an entity is a real-world object).

        This “clever opener likely to leave readers breathless both with laughter and anticipation”
        (Kirkus Reviews, starred review)
        is the first in the New York Times bestselling series from the author of the Half Upon a Time trilogy.

        Life is boring when you live in the real world,
        instead of starring in your own book series. Owen knows that better than anyone, what with the real world’s homework and chores.
        But everything changes the day Owen sees the impossible happen—his classmate Bethany climb out of a book in the library. It turns out Bethany’s
        half-fictional and has been searching every book she can find for her missing father, a fictional character.

        Bethany can’t let anyone else learn her secret, so Owen makes her a deal:
        All she has to do is take him into a book in Owen’s favorite Kiel Gnomenfoot series,
        and he’ll never say a word. Besides, visiting the book might help Bethany find her father…
        Or it might just destroy the Kiel Gnomenfoot series, reveal Bethany’s secret to the entire world,
        and force Owen to live out Kiel Gnomenfoot’s final (very final) adventure.

        The baby owls came out of their house,

        When three baby owls awake one night to find their mother gone, they cannot help but wonder where she
